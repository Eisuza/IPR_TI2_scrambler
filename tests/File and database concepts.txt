FILE AND DATABASE CONCEPTS
In the broadest definition, a database is a collection of information. Today, databases are typically stored as computer files. The tasks associated with creating, maintaining, and accessing the information in these files are referred to as data management, file management, or database management. The basic element of a structured  file is a field. Is contains the smallest unit of meaningful information. Each field has a unique filed name that desribes its contets. For example, in the Vintage Music Shop database, the field name Album Title describes a field containing the name of an album, such as Hard Days' night. A field can be varialbe length or fixed length. A variable-length field is like an accordion - it epands to fit the data you enter, up to some maximum number of characters. A fixed-length field contains a predetermined number of character(bytes). The data you enter is a fixed-length field cannot exceed the allocated field length. Mereover, if the data you enter is shorter than the allocated lenght, blank spaces are automatically added to fill the field.
In the world of computing, a record refers to a collection of data fields. Computer databases typically display records as rows in a table of as forms. Each kind of record is referred to as a record type. It si ususally shown without any data in the fields. A record that contains data is referred to as a record occurrence, or simply a record.
A structure file that contains only one record type is often referred to as a flad file. Flat files can be used to store simple data, such as names and addresses. In contrast,  a database can contain a variety of different record types. A key characteristic of a database is its ability to maintain relationships do that data from several record types can be consolidated or agregated into essentially one unit for data retrieval and reporting purposes. In data jargon, a relationship is an association between data that's stored in different record types. For example Vintage Music Shop's customors record type is related to the Orders record type because customers place orders.
An important aspec of the relationship between record types is cordinality. Cardinality refers to the number of associations that can exist between two record types. When one record is related to many records, that relationship is referred to as a one-to-many relationship. A many-to-many relationship means that one record in a particular record type can be related to many recordd in another record type, or vice versa. The relationship between record types can be depicted graphically with an entity-relationship diagram (sometimes called an "ER diagram" or "ERD").
